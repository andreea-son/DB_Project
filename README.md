## About info
* This project is focused on working with databases and modeling a real-life like database model, along with developing a user interface that can help manage it easier.

## Requirements met
* A document containing:
   1. Presentation of the database model (from the real world) and its rules;
   2. * Entity-relationship diagram;
      * Description of entities, attributes, keys, relationships and cardinalities.
   3. * Conceptual diagram;
      * Description of integrity constraints;
      * Relational schemes.
* The previously represented model will be implemented in a database management system, installed locally:
   1. Creating tables (including constraints);
   2. Inserting data into the previously created tables.
* Interaction with the database will be performed from an interface (preferably web) that will meet the following requirements:
   1. Listing content with the possibility of sorting;
   2. Editing information (edit/delete option for each record).

## Technologies
* Programming languages: Java, SQL;
* IDEs: Oracle SQL Developer, IntelliJ IDEA.

## Status
